<h1 align="center">üåê Opinionated Sapper project base</h1>

## ‚ùì What is this?
The site that builds from this repository can be found [here](https://fir-sapper-tailwindcss.web.app/).

This is an extremely opinionated Sapper project base intended for my own use. That being said, there is quite a bit of work put into it to make it generalized and adaptable to your own setup, given that you want to use *most* of these things. The lower something is on this list, the easier it is to reconfigure or remove:
- [Sapper for Svelte](https://sapper.svelte.dev/)
  - [Official VS Code Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
  - [Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/) for Server Side Rendering (SSR)
  - [Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) for static assets
  - Thanks to [@Eckhardt-D](https://github.com/Eckhardt-D)'s [`sapper-firebase-starter`](https://github.com/Eckhardt-D/sapper-firebase-starter)
  - Thanks to [@nhristov](https://github.com/nhristov)'s [`sapper-template-firebase`](https://github.com/nhristov/sapper-template-firebase)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - [TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.ml/)
  - Inside Svelte components, thanks to [`svelte-preprocess`](https://github.com/kaisermann/svelte-preprocess)

  - [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import)
  - [PurgeCSS](https://www.purgecss.com/)
  - [CSSNano](https://cssnano.co/)
  - Inside Svelte components, thanks to [`svelte-preprocess`](https://github.com/kaisermann/svelte-preprocess)
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
  - Automatic building and deployment to Firebase, triggered on commits to `main` or `master`
- [Progressive Web App (PWA)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) best practices set up
  - [`manifest.json`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest)'s most important fields filled out
  - High [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) audit score
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
  - [VS Code Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
  - `eslint:fix` package script

This template comes from combining two of my smaller ones: [one for Tailwind CSS (PostCSS)](https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-postcss-template), and [another for TypeScript and GraphQL](https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-typescript-graphql-template). If this is too much for you, check out one of those!

## üìã Copy

Choose either to clone or fork depending on your preference.

### üêë Clone

```sh
git clone https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-firebase-typescript-graphql-tailwindcss-actions-template
```

### üç¥ Fork

Click the `Use this template` button on [this project's GitHub page](https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-firebase-typescript-graphql-tailwindcss-actions-template).

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Install Dependencies
You need to be using version 12 or higher of Node; the `package.json` `engines` field only specifies `10` for Cloud Functions for Firebase.

```sh
cd sapper-firebase-typescript-graphql-tailwindcss-actions-template
npm install  # pnpm also works
```

## üõ† Usage

### üß™ Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### üî• Deployment to Firebase
This will create a production build for you before deploying.
```sh
npm run deploy
```

If you do not need to include heavy Babel transforms and polyfills to support old browsers on your site, then remove the `--legacy` flag in the `sapper:build` package script to lighten it up.

### üî® Testing Production Builds Locally
This probably pairs well with [Firebase Emulators](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules/emulator-setup).
```sh
npm run prod
npm run start
```

### üì¶ Deploying a Static Site to Firebase Hosting
Cloud Functions for Firebase [requires billing set up with the Blaze Plan](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15), but you can stay on the Spark Plan for a free and fast (no cold starts!) static site:
```sh
npm run deploy:export
```

This will create an exported build for you before deploying.

If your project is transitioning from SSR to a static site, be sure to delete the residual `ssr` Cloud Function:

```sh
npm run firebase functions:delete ssr
```

You will also need to remove `rewrites` from `firebase.json`.

If you do not need to include heavy Babel transforms and polyfills to support old browsers on your site, then remove the `--legacy` flag in the `sapper:export` package script to lighten it up.

## ‚öô Configuration

### üî• Firebase and üêô GitHub Actions
The least you should need to do to get started is to edit `.firebaserc`, changing the project ID to *your* project (initialized in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)) ID.

For automatic building and deployment to work, you need to generate [a CI login token from Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#cli-ci-systems):
```sh
npm run firebase login:ci
```
Then, go to your repository's Settings > Secrets. Copy the result of the command above and save it as a Secret named `FIREBASE_TOKEN`.

You can test if it's working by making a commit to `main` or `master` and checking the Actions tab of your repository to see if your project successfully builds and deploys to Firebase.

### ‚ö° Web app
Many of the fields in `static/manifest.json` (`short_name`, `name`, `description`, `categories`, `theme_color`, and `background_color`) are filled with demonstrative values that won't match your site. Similarly, you've got to take new screenshots to replace the included `static/screenshot-1.png` and `static/screenshot-2.png` files. If you want, you can add [app shortcut definitions for "add to home screen" on Android](https://web.dev/app-shortcuts/#define-app-shortcuts-in-the-web-app-manifest). Once you change `theme_color`, update the `meta name="theme-color"` tag in `src/template.html` to match.

The [Apple touch icon](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html), favicon, and `logo-` files (also all in the `static` directory) are created by placing the logo within a "safe area" centered circle that takes up 80% of the canvas's dimension. For instance, the constraining circle in `logo-512.png` is 512 √ó 0.80 = 409.6 ‚âà 410 pixels wide and tall. 

### üó∫ Source maps
This project base comes with [source maps](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-source-maps) enabled during development and disabled during production for the best compromise between performance and developer experience. You can change this behavior through the `sourcemap` variable in `rollup.config.js`.

### üí® Optionally removing Tailwind CSS

1. Remove all Tailwind imports in the `src/global.pcss` file
2. Remove these lines in `postcss.config.js`:
    1. ```js
       import tailwindcss from "tailwindcss";
       ```
    3. ```js
       import tailwindcssConfig from "./tailwind.config";
       ```
    3. ```js
       tailwindcss(tailwindcssConfig),
       ```
3. Delete the `tailwind.config.js` file
4. Uninstall the `tailwindcss` package

## üòµ Help! I have a question

[Create an issue](https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-typescript-graphql-template/issues/new) and I'll try to help.

## üò° Fix! There is something that needs improvement

[Create an issue](https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-typescript-graphql-template/issues/new) or [pull request](https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-typescript-graphql-template/pulls) and I'll try to fix.

I'm sorry, because of my skill level and the fragility of (the combination of) some of these tools, there are likely to be problems in this project. Thank you for bringing them to my attention or fixing them for me.
